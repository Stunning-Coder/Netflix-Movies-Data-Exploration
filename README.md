## Introduction

### About the project

> **"** In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to `pandas` and `matplotlib`. You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. **"**

### Prerequisites

**Technology:**
> Python

To be able to take on this project, I needed to have learned:

1. **Courses:**
    - [Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
    - [Intermediate Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python)

2. **Concepts:**
    - Data Manipulation
    - Data Visualization
    - Python Basics & Programming

### Goals

In taking on this project, I was trying to:
- use the provided data to investigate a trend
- visualize the data and any trends

# Conclusion

The project was carried out to find out if Netflix movies and series are indeed getting shorter.
The answer, which is visible from the short analysis and the graphs plotted, is **YES.** - Yes, the movies on Netflix ARE getting shorter.
